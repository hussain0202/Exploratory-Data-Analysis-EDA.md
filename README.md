# Exploratory-Data-Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.

I did an investigations on Sales data using RStudio to discover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

I have attached the RMD file of my EDA which contains all the code and the explanation of the steps. Furthermore, I have also attached the questions file which contains all the bussiness questions that you can answer using the exploratory data analysis file.
